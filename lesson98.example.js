/*
as we have see in earlier examples. objects can contain both
nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to acessing nested object, array bracket 
notation can be chained to acess nested arrays.
here is an example of how to acess a nested array:

*/

var ourPets = [ 
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer"
      "Fluffly",
      "Kit_cat"
      
      ]
  },
  
  {
    ANIMALTYPE: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"'
      ]
  }
  ],
    ourPets[0].names[1]
ourPets[1];.names[0];
