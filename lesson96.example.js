/*

Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. 
A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. 
They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, 
numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:



*/

var ourMusic = [
  { 
    "artist" : "Daft Punk",
    "title":"Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "Casette"
      "LP""
      ]'
    "gold": true
  }
  ];
