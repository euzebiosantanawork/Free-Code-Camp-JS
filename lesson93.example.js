// We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;


//Example:

var ourDog = {
  "name":"Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends" ; ["everthing!"],
  "bark": bow=wow"

};

delte ourDog.bark;

{
  
  "name" : "Camper"
  "legs": 4
  "tails": 1;
  "friends": ["everthing!"]
  
}

//Delete the tais property from myDog
